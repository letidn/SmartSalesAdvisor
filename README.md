# SmartSalesAdvisor

**An intelligent decision-support system for microentrepreneurs, based on Business Economics and Decision Tree inference.**

## Description

SmartSalesAdvisor is a Java-based decision-support tool aimed at microentrepreneurs with limited financial literacy. The system evaluates business conditions and provides scenario-driven recommendations using principles from Business Economics and a rule-based decision tree model.

## Features

- Break-even point analysis grounded in economic theory  
- Inference engine based on a deterministic decision tree  
- Generation of actionable recommendations (alerts, suggestions, confirmations)  
- Targeted at service-oriented microenterprises  
- High accuracy (0.9978 with synthetic data)

## Requirements

- Java 11 or higher  
- Javaâ„¢ SE Runtime Environment (build 23.0.2+7-58)  
- Python 3.10+ (for model validation)  
- Python libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartSalesAdvisor.git
```

Open the project in your preferred IDE and run `SmartSalesAdvisor.java`.

## Usage

1. The user answers a series of guided questions related to their business.  
2. The system evaluates the input using a decision tree derived from encoded business rules.  
3. The system displays a message (M1â€“M11) along with tailored recommendations.

Example output:

```text
Message: M4 â€“ "The company needs to conduct a price review."
```

## Folder Structure

```
/src                      # Java source files  
SmartSalesAdvisor.java   # Main application file   
Synthetic_Dataset_SmartSalesAdvisor.IPYNB # Python validation script  
/data                    # Synthetic dataset  
/figures                 # Decision tree and use case diagrams  
```

## Reproducibility

To reproduce the modelâ€™s accuracy:

1. Run the script `Synthetic_Dataset_SmartSalesAdvisor.IPYNB`, which:  
   - Generates a synthetic dataset based on inference rules  
   - Trains a decision tree classifier  
   - Evaluates the model using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  
   - Performs 4-fold cross-validation

Example output:

```yaml
Accuracy: 0.9993
Cross-Validation Scores:
[1.0000, 1.0000, 1.000, 0.9973]

```

This confirms the consistency and robustness of the decision logic before system deployment.

## ðŸ“˜ Developer Guide

This section provides instructions for developers who wish to compile, run, or extend the SmartSalesAdvisor system.

### ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- A Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

### ðŸ“¦ Installation and Execution

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the ZIP file):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/letidn/SmartSalesAdvisor.git
   cd SmartSalesAdvisor
   ```

2. **Compile the Java source** (via terminal or your IDE):

   ```bash
   javac SmartSalesAdvisor.java
   ```

3. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   java SmartSalesAdvisor
   ```

> If your project uses multiple source files (e.g., `SmartSalesAdvisor.java`), make sure all files are compiled before execution.

### ðŸ›  Notes for Extension

- The class `SmartSalesAdvisor` initializes the interface and decision logic.
- The business rules are encoded in the decision tree and can be modified or extended to cover additional scenarios.
- `Synthetic_Dataset_SmartSalesAdvisor.ipynb` provides a validation routine for the decision logic using synthetic data and scikit-learn.

For general usage instructions, see the "Usage" section above.
